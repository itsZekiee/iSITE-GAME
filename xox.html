            <p>
                Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbols (X or O).
                The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. 
                This version includes a timer for each player and keeps track of wins across multiple matches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is played in a "best of three" format. Once a player reaches three wins, they are declared the winner.
                Enjoy and may the best player win!
